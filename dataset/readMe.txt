INTRO
*****
The dataset contains a series of images recorded during a pilot user study carried out in 2018 at ACRV in the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia.
In this pilot user study, volunteer participants were asked to form a shape with some kinetic sand in a sandbox, while being recorded with a fixed RGB-D camera (Intel RealSense, resolution 640 x 480). The camera was pointing at the sandbox from above, with optical axis perpendicular to it. 
After being given time to train and to get used to manipulating the sand, each participant was requested to produce the same shape three times: a) using both hands, b) using only one hand and finally c) using one of two provided tools. 
Finally, a questionnaire was filled in by the partakers.
